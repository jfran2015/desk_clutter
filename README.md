# Analysis of desk clutter project

This is my 2021-2022 UCARE project on how desk clutter effects cognitive processing.
The file_creation.R file reads in the data from individual participants to larger data frames.
The analysis.R file takes those data frames and summarises them and uses them in ANOVA testing.
